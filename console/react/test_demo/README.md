# Test Demo

Page which shows all important Console components, for manual inspection and testing without router present.

Run the following in the `console/react` directory.

    npx webpack serve

TODO: This is a WIP thing. I am not completely convinced it makes sense being to able to have pages with isolated components like this, but it sounds reasonable to me.
I was thinking that it could possibly be turned into an image-diffing test, or "selenium-like" test. Just to automatically make sure that the page looks the same as before, and to make it easier to review intended changes.
