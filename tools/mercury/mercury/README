An example versions file, that can get included by some other script:
( If you call this file 'versions', the example script below will include it. )


         version_roots name latest dispatch /home/mick/latest/install/dispatch proton /home/mick/latest/install/proton



An example run script to start mercury and run a script:




            #! /usr/bin/bash


            export MERCURY_ROOT=${HOME}/mercury
            export GOPATH=${MERCURY_ROOT}


            go run ./*.go ./franz





An example script that runs a little test.
This script will cause Mercury to make a linear network 
of three routers. It will put 10 dsenders in router A
and 10 receivers on router C. The 10 senders will use 
addresses addr_1, addr_2, ... addr_10 ,
and so will the 10 receivers.
And then each sender will send 10,000 messages.
Fifteen seconds after receiver finishes, it will write its
saved flight-times information to a file in the sessions
directory.
( Each Mercury run gets its own session directory. )
